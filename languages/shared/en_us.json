  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.2": "Hey neighbor! We finally get to go there!",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.3": "However, there are two things you need to keep in mind.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.4": "First, this key can only teleport you to the Dream World. If you wish to truly arrive in Gensokyo, you will have to look for a method to access the reality world.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.5": "Second... Gensokyo is currently a big mess.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.6": "Hmm? Why?",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.7": "As you can see here, a lot of monsters start to appear out of nowhere, and they all have this... weird blocky shape.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.8": "These blocky monsters seem to have spread all the way to Gensokyo, so the reality world is now nothing but chaos.",

  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.0": "You do seem to... have excellent skills.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.1": "Oh, it seems like I haven't properly introduced myself.",

  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.3": "Huh? You are... Orant?",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.4": "...You know me?",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.5": "Ah, I've heard this name.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.6": "In our villages, we rely on Iron Golems to defend from those monsters!",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.7": "And you, should be the creator of the Iron Golems' prototypes?",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.8": "Iron Golems... Ah, Somewhat.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.9": "But... I've left that behind for a long time.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.name": "Halloween Day 2 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.0": "Is this... Glowstone?",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.1": "A kind of glowing stone from the Nether... Extremely rare in the overworld.",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.2": "It... glows. But... what needs to be lit...?",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.3": "...Perhaps...",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.4": "Ghosts will begin wandering.",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.name": "Halloween Day 3 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.0": "I’ve been noticing... some strange things about this swamp.",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.1": "We’ve stayed here for 4 days, but it's still Halloween’s eve!",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.2": "Ah, That's because this place has been witched.",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.3": "Or cursed... The time of this swamp will be Halloween’s eve forever.",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.4": "Just like a mysterious painting... where time stopped eternally.",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.5": "That’s a weird phenomenon and all, but it won’t get in our way.",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.0.6": "Well then, neighbor, keep on finding the Almanac!",
  "chat.halloween_map.4.name": "Halloween Day 4 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.0": "Hm, that's to say... Why did you guys follow that map all the way over here?",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.1": "Ah! I almost forgot!",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.10": "That monster... was so strong that fleeing was my only choice. And the key was robbed at that time.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.11": "Oh, that ain’t good.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.2": "We wanna go to another world called Gensokyo! We’ve been looking everywhere for a way to get there!",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.3": "Go to... another world, isn’t it? Right, I do have such a method for that.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.4": "I have a magical key, it can open a portal to the Dream World, which connects to other worlds.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.5": "Ooh, is that so? Then could you help sending us there?",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.6": "Um... To be honest, there’s a problem.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.7": "That key was stolen.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.8": "...? Stolen?",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.9": "When I was on patrol nearby, I was attacked by a... monster.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.name": "Halloween Day 5 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.0": "So, what's the monster that attacked you?",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.1": "A giant, terrible and strong corpse monster, powered with enormous amount of electricity. It's called... Frankenstein.",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.2": "Frankenstein? But that's just some fictional stuff from a novel!",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.3": "I also thought it was... but it really does exist.",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.4": "Sorry for my negligence... the situation should’ve not been like this.",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.5": "Never mind that, we just need to get the key back!",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.6": "...If you wish to combat with the monster, please take caution...",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.name": "Halloween Day 6 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.0": "I’ve been wondering, any idea on what the key looks like?",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.1": "That key is called the Dream Key.",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.2": "Using a Dream Key is one way to teleport to other worlds. However, a downside to this method is, you must first visit the Dream World of your targeted world.",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.3": "You’ll later have to find a way to manually access the reality of that world via its Dream World as well. Teleporting you to the Dream World is all the key can do.",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.4": "Still sounds like a cool thing for me!",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.5": "If we have one, we can definitely go to Gensokyo!",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.name": "Halloween Day 7 Map",
  "chat.halloween_over.1.0.0": "This is our old friend, Small Dispenser!",
  "chat.halloween_over.1.0.1": "Say hello to our little friend!",
  "chat.halloween_over.1.0.2": "Small Dispensers don't need ME to be placed. They can shoot short-ranged snowballs and are great contraptions for the night!",

  "chat.halloween_over.1.0.4": "...You are?",
  "chat.halloween_over.1.name": "Halloween Day 1 Outro",
  "chat.halloween_over.11.0.0": "This is my Dream Key! You did it!",
  "chat.halloween_over.11.0.1": "And with that, Frankenstein has also returned to the place where he belongs.",
  "chat.halloween_over.11.0.2": "I am truly grateful for all that you have done for me so far.",

  "chat.halloween_over.11.name": "Halloween Day 11 Outro",

  "chat.halloween_over.2.0.1": "It can automatically produce ME under the moonlight or in darkness! \nAnd it increases its yield after a while!",

  "chat.halloween_over.2.name": "Halloween Day 2 Outro",
  "chat.halloween_over.3.0.0": "This is Glowstone, it can light up an area around it and dispel fog!",
  "chat.halloween_over.3.0.1": "But... where is fog in a place full of moonlight?",
  "chat.halloween_over.3.0.2": "What is it used for?",
  "chat.halloween_over.3.name": "Halloween Day 3 Outro",
  "chat.halloween_over.4.0.0": "This is Punchton!",
  "chat.halloween_over.4.0.1": "It can knock back enemies for a long distance! And heavily damage fragile stones or other objects!",
  "chat.halloween_over.4.0.2": "However, it will be broken after the punch, and needs some time to repair itself!",
  "chat.halloween_over.4.0.3": "Break them up!",

  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.0": "Aha! Finally we found Orant's Almanac!",
  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.1": "Yes! This is... My Almanac!",
  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.2": "Thank you... However, perhaps you need this more than I do.",
  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.3": "Hm?",
  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.4": "...This Almanac will automatically record contraptions, enemies and other infomation you've come across- it is a really convenient tool.",
  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.5": "If it's you, you might make the most out of it.",
  "chat.halloween_over.5.0.6": "And to express my appreciation, please take it as a gift.",

  "chat.halloween_over.6.0.1": "This is TNT! After you trigger it, it will go KABOOM and blow up all the surrounding enemies!",

  "chat.halloween_over.6.name": "Halloween Day 6 Outro",
  "chat.halloween_over.7.0.0": "Your soul shall be mine!",
  "chat.halloween_over.7.0.1": "Behold, the Soul Furnace! It can shoot DEADLY soulfire balls and burn groups of enemies upon hit!",
  "chat.halloween_over.7.0.2": "But what does it cost? It needs to sacrifice a contraption in front of it as its fuel!",
  "chat.halloween_over.7.0.3": "Let the enemies BURN IN HELL!",
  "chat.halloween_over.7.name": "Halloween Day 7 Outro",
  "chat.halloween_over.8.0.0": "The Perfect and Elegant Dispenser is here!",
  "chat.halloween_over.8.0.1": "Here comes Silvenser! Its knives can slice fleshes and deal more damages! And can pierce anything which are not hard!",

  "chat.halloween_over.8.name": "Halloween Day 8 Outro",
  "chat.halloween_over.9.0.0": "Do you still remember the clown fairy from Hell?",
  "chat.halloween_over.9.0.1": "Magic Chest, or Magichest! It swallows an enemy in front of it, and then transforms itself into a Starshard!",
  "chat.halloween_over.9.0.2": "Who's up for a magic show?",
